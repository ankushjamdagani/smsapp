Technicality-
<br>
1. This app basically works on local storage.<br>
2. JQuery, Materialize and font awesome are included using CDNs. Therefore you need to connect to internet to use the app.<br>
3. Technincally No SMS per se is sent to mobile number. I would have to install a server to use that feature. Its all about storing data in local storage.<br>


Functionality-
<br />
1. You can add contact on the left pane<br>
2. You can send messages to already existing contacts that are later viewed on right pane.<br>
3. Message sent is some OTP message that is generated randomly.<br>
4. The data messages and contacts remains stored in your browser local storage unless you empty browser's local storage.<br>
